# ATB input pipeline

This directory turns raw NLR Annual Technology Baseline (ATB) data into ReEDS
input files and plots. The workflow has three explicit stages:

1. download and inspect raw data;
2. format the local raw data for ReEDS;
3. plot metrics from the same local raw data.

## Configure the run

[`config.yaml`](config.yaml) is the user-facing control file. It shows which
stages will run, the ATB release and source URLs, local filenames, ReEDS path,
technologies, processing choices, and plotting choices.

Review that file first, especially:

- `atb.year` and `atb.dollar_year`;
- the two `raw_data` URLs and filenames;
- `processing.reeds_repo` and selected technologies;
- the metrics and technologies under `plotting`.

## Run one step at a time

Run the following commands from the `atb/` directory.

### Step 1: scrape raw inputs

```bash
python scripts/scrape_atb_inputs.py
```

This downloads or reuses both independent raw inputs:

- `scraped_input/atb_<year>_flat_file.csv`;
- `scraped_input/atb_<year>_workbook.xlsx`.

It then displays a summary of the flat file and the workbook sheets. Existing
files are reused unless `--force` is supplied:

```bash
python scripts/scrape_atb_inputs.py --force
```

Downloads normally verify HTTPS certificates. If certificate verification
fails because the active conda environment does not trust an NLR network
inspection certificate, `raw_data.allow_insecure_ssl_fallback: true` permits a
clearly labeled `verify=False` retry. Set it to `false` to prohibit that retry.

### Step 2: format ReEDS inputs

```bash
python scripts/generate_atb_files.py
```

This reads the local raw files plus `manual_input/` and existing ReEDS inputs,
then writes ReEDS-formatted CSVs to `output/`. It does **not** download raw
data. If a required raw file is missing, run Step 1 first.

Whether this step generates cost files and financial files, which technologies
it processes, and whether it copies results into ReEDS are all controlled under
`processing:` in `config.yaml`.

### Step 3: plot raw ATB data

```bash
python scripts/atb_plotting.py
```

This reads the same local flat file used in Step 2 and saves the configured
figures to `figures/`. It does not scrape data or plot the formatted files from
`output/`.

## Run the configured pipeline

To run the enabled stages in order, set the switches under `workflow:` in
`config.yaml`, then run:

```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py
```

The runner prints which stages will run before doing any work. A stage can also
be selected explicitly:

```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --only scrape
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --only format
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --only plot
```

## Data flow

```text
config.yaml
    |
    +--> scrape_atb_inputs.py
    |        +--> scraped_input/atb_<year>_flat_file.csv
    |        +--> scraped_input/atb_<year>_workbook.xlsx
    |        +--> terminal summaries/previews of both raw files
    |
    +--> generate_atb_files.py
    |        +--> raw flat file (primary ATB data)
    |        +--> raw workbook (battery power/energy cost split)
    |        +--> manual_input/ (CSP ratios and historic/fallback data)
    |        +--> existing ReEDS inputs (history and dollar-year conversion)
    |        +--> output/*_ATB_<year>_<scenario>.csv
    |
    +--> atb_plotting.py
             +--> the same raw flat file
             +--> figures/
```

The flat file and workbook are independent upstream downloads. Neither is
generated from the other. The formatter and plotter do not download data; they
only consume the raw files created by the scraper.
